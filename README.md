### EDA:

* Where do most pickups occur? (for each season)
* Where do most dropoffs occur? (for each season)
* Do credit cards tip more than cash?
* For pickups/dropoffs, which locations generate the most revenue? (for each season)
* Do we see a dip/spike in trips based on weather?
* Do higher socioeconomic areas request more pickups?
* Can we predict the tip based on pickup and dropoff point?
* What is the spatial autocorrelation between socioeconomic location and tip?
* Do taxi pickups occur more/less around bus-stops?
* Do taxi pickups occur more/less around divy stops? (spring/summer/fall)
* Number of taxi trips by day (check against the holidays)


### ML:
